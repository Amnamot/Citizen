        is a stable and individual set of qualities that determines how a person
        interacts with the world around him or her, his or her preferences,
        inclinations, motivations, behavioral and emotional reactions.

      <div class="text">
        Some of the qualities may be more pronounced than others and may
        manifest differently depending on the situation and context. In
        addition, character can develop and change over the course of life as a
        result of experience, learning, and interaction with the world around
        us.

        Character traits subconsciously influence one decision or another,
        without much consciousness. And only the subsequent evaluation of the
        consequences of the action and conclusions, lead to changes in the
        character and behavior of the person - so there is personal growth.
